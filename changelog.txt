1.0 Beta 2 release 6 - Not released
- Removed a bit of debug output left in by accident.
- Fixed a bug in the notification dialogs and made them use the system fade/slide
  settings.
- Fixed options file being written constantly when window was being moved.  This
  resulted in huge slowdown when AV products are in use slowing down the application as
  it writes to disk.
- Made some changes to the update dialog.  It will now check for and download updates
  regardless of whether or not you are "busy" with the app.  However when it goes to
  apply the update, it will ask you first, and will not allow updates to be applied
  if the program is doing something that shouldn't be interrupted.  If the program is
  busy, the update will be deferred until you restart the program.  You will also be
  notified when a successful update has occurred.
- Fixed DarkXL path selection never finding DarkXL.
- Switched to .NET 4.0.
- Fixed update dialog crashing Knight on 64-bit systems.
- Fixed a bug where settings wouldn't be written to disk if the directory did not exist
  (eg you changed the install location).
- Fixed a bug where a disabled game could be expanded in the list on startup.
- Fixed a bug where, if a game had an invalid path on startup, selecting a valid path
  would cause the UI to glitch and show the game as partly disabled and enabled.
- Fixed Jedi Knight Options dialog blowing up on saving settings if you don't select
  a path for patches.
- Adding missing license notice for #ZipLib.
- Removed known bug about weird icon view... not an issue with modern Windows.

- Fixed bug where a mod's long file name would get passed to Dark Forces.
- Main window can no longer open off-screen.  If invalid values are saved to options or
  you change your screen resolution or monitor setup so that Knight's saved position is
  no longer valid, the window position will reset.
- Reworked the "Working" dialog backend.

1.0 Beta release 4 - 10/06/09
- Possibly fixed a race condition bug where hashes were being computed incorrectly,
  causing known patches to show up as "Unknown Patch" and occasionally unnecessary
  backup copies made.
